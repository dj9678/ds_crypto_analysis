# ds_cryptocurrency_trends

This repo is aiming to figure out the trends of cryptocurrencies by visualizing the historical market data. I will use Cryptowatch API to collect the historical market price of big cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dogecoin. I will plot individual graph for each coin, then plot all of graph together. Even though it is well known fact that crpytocurrency market is heavily affected by the price movement of bitcoin and etherium, it will be still fun to check out the trend through the graphes.

## Overview

- `Requests.get API`
- Sorting out the data in certain period by using `loc`
- Setting up index for data frame 
- Changing the time format using `to_datetime`
- Exploring the data set using pandas commands
- Plotting the single version of graph and the combined version of graph
- Combining each data frames into one data frame by using `append()` 
- Creating new column and rearrange the data frame
- Converting value to `log` format
